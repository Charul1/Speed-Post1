		\n<b>This kiosk has been developed to make the process of posting easier and more efficient for the
citizens of India. Following is how it can be done:</b>
        \n
<b><i>1.</i></b>	A QR code needs to be generated, which will contain the information about the address of the
	sender and the receiver. This QR code can be generated at home using our app (whatever the
	name of the app is, with its QR code for scanning maybe, so that it becomes more convenient
	for the user) or it can be printed by this machine by clicking on<i>“Print QR code”</i> .\n
<b><i>2.</i></b>	Once the QR code is printed and pasted on the letter/parcel, you can go to <i>“Post the
	letter/parcel”</i>.\n
<b><i>3.</i></b>	You will have to let the machine scan the QR code first and put the letter into the designated
	place below. The letter will be locked in the box.\n
<b><i>4.</i></b>	<i>(Optional)</i> A map to show the destination will be shown for confirmation.\n
<b><i>5.</i></b>	You can then click on <i>“Make Payment”</i> option and make the payment using our app (again, if
	that is the way it is supposed to be done) or any other application (maybe note acceptor as
	well?).\n
<b><i>6.</i></b>	Once the payment is approved and accepted, the letter will be dropped inside the machine and
	you are good to go!\n

<b><i>7.</i></b>	Make sure the scanned QR code is the same as that pasted on the letter or you letter
	will not reach the correct destination.
